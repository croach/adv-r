## Introduction

Now that you understand the tree structure of R code, it's time to come back to one of the fundamental ideas that make `expr()` and `ast()` work: __quasiquotation__.  There are two pieces to quasiquotation:

* Quoting allows you to capture the AST associated with a function argument 
  without evaluating it.
  
* Unquoting allows you to selectively evaluate parts of an expression that 
  would otherwise be quoted.

This combination of these two ideas makes it easy to compose expressions that are mixtures of direct and indirect specifications and makes it easier to solve a wide variety of challenging problems. 

Quasiquotation is available in base R, but is implemented in the the rlang package. We'll begin the chapter by using rlang to dive into the details of quasiquotation. Next, we'll circle back to base R. You'll learn the closest equivalents to rlang's quoting functions, and the variety of techniques that base R uses for unquoting. We'll finish the chapter with a case study: using quasiquotation to construct calls "by hand". This is a useful technique for creating simple function operators with readable source code, and is a handy technique to work around functions (in base R and elsewhere) that don't support unquoting.

The ideas presented in this chapter are rather similar to Lisp __macros__, as discussed in [Programmer's Niche: Macros in R](http://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2001-3.pdf#page=10) by Thomas Lumley. However, macros are run at compile-time, which doesn't have any meaning in R, and always return expressions. They're also somewhat like Lisp [__fexprs__](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fexpr), functions where all arguments are quoted by default. These terms are useful to know when looking for related techniques in other programming languages. \index{macros} \index{fexprs}

### Motivation

We'll start with a simple, concrete, example that helps motivate the need for unquoting, and hence quasiquotation. Imagine you're creating a lot of strings by joining together words:

```{r}
paste("Good", "morning", "Hadley")
paste("Good", "afternoon", "Alice")
```

You are sick and tired of writing all those quotes, and instead you just want to use bare words. To that end, you've managed to write the following function and it works! (We'll talk about the details of this implementation later; for now just look at the results.)

```{r}
cement <- function(...) {
  exprs(...) %>% 
    map(expr_name) %>% 
    paste(collapse = " ")
}

cement(Good, morning, Hadley)
cement(Good, afternoon, Alice)
```

Formally, this function __quotes__ the arguments in `...`, because you can think of it as  automatically putting quotation marks around each argument (that's a bit of a simplification; we'll cover the full details later). 

This is nice because we no longer need to type quotes. The problem, however, comes when we want to use variables. It's easy to use variables with `paste()` we just don't surround them with quote marks:

```{r}
name <- "Hadley"
time <- "morning"

paste("Good", time, name)
```

Obviously this doesn't work with `cement()` because every input is automatically quoted:

```{r}
cement(Good, time, name)
```

We need some way to explicitly __unquote__ the input, to tell `cement()` to remove the invisible quote marks that it is adding automatically. In this example, we need someway to tell `cement()` that `time` and `name` should be handled differently to `Good`.  quasiquotation give us a standard tool to do so: `!!`, prounounced bang-bang.

```{r}
cement(Good, !!time, !!name)
```

It's useful to compare `cement()` and `paste()` directly. `paste()` evaluates its arguments, so we need to quote where needed; `cement()` quotes its arguments, so we need to unquote where needed.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
paste("Good", name, time)
cement(Good, !!time, !!name)
```

## Quasiquotation

The idea of quasiquotation is an old one. It was first developed by a philsopher, Willard van Orman Quine[^1], in the early 1940s. It's needed in philosophy because it helps to be precise between the use and mention of words, i.e. between the object and the words we use to refer to that object. For example, here are three examples from a class on "[Substitutional Quantifiers](https://johnmacfarlane.net/142/substitutional-quantifiers.pdf)" taught by John MacFarlane [^2].

*  'net' is part of 'clarinet', but a net is not part of a clarinet.

*  Boston is a city. 'Boston' is the name of a city. ``Boston`` is not the 
   name of a city; it denotes the name of a city.

*  An hour is longer than a minute, but 'minute' is longer than 'hour'.

[^1]: You might be familiar with the name Quine from "quines", computer programs that when run return a copy of their own source code.
[^2]: In another interesting connection, John MacFarlane is the author of pandoc which is used as part of the RMarkdown toolchain to generate pdfs, ebooks, and websites like this book.

It wasn't until the mid-1970s that quasiquotation entered common use in a programming language: LISP. Useful history at <http://repository.readscheme.org/ftp/papers/pepm99/bawden.pdf>. Another way of thinking about quasiquotation is that it provides a code template. You define an AST with some "holes" that get filled in using the values of other variables.

We use quasiquotation to refer to the specific form of unquoting used inside otherwise quoted content. In tidy evaluation it uses `!!`.  But other languages use slightly different approaches. For example, in LISP you always use `` ` `` to quasi-quote an expression (arguments never automatically quote for you), and you use `,` to unquote. In julia you use `:` to quote and `@` to unquote.

Quasiquotation is useful in R because it allows us to have a systematic way of distinguishing when we want to refer to the name `x` vs. the contents of the variable called `x`.

### Quoting

Every function that quotes one or more arguments and provides quasiquotation must call one of the following three functions provided by rlang:

* `expr()` captures its argument exactly as given. You'll use this most
  commonly for interactive exploration.

* `enexpr()` takes the name of an argument to a function, and returns
  the expression provided by that argument.
  
* `exprs()` captures all arguments. It has two uses: you can use it 
  interactively to generate a list of expressions, or inside a function to 
  capture all arguments provided to `...`.

(There are three variants called `quo()`, `enquo()`, `quos()` that capture both the expression and the environment. We'll come back to those in the next chapter.

Let's compare the use of `expr()` and `enexpr()` inside a function: 

```{r}
capture_1 <- function(x) expr(x)
capture_2 <- function(x) enexpr(x)

capture_1(x + y)
capture_2(x + y)
```

`expr()` always yields whatever is passed in. When you need to construct an expression from known inputs use `expr()`. When you need to capture an expression provided by the user in an argument, use `enexpr()`.  

Depending on how you call it, `exprs()` combines some of the behaviour of `expr()` and `enexpr()`. It behaves like `enexpr()` if you pass in `...`, and behaves like `expr()` for all other arguments:

```{r}
f <- function(x, ...) {
  exprs(x = x, ...)
}
f(x = y + 1, y = y + 1)
```

Generally, you'll use `exprs()` in one of two ways:

```{r}
# Interactively creating a list of expressions
exprs(x = x ^ 2, y = y ^ 3, z = z ^ 4)
# short hand for
list(x = expr(x ^ 2), y = expr(y ^ 3), z = expr(z ^ 4))

# To capture all ... inside a function
foo <- function(...) {
  dots <- exprs(...)
}
```

There's not much you can do with a list of expressions yet, but we'll see a few techniques later on in this chapter. Lists of expressions + rlang + purrr give you a surprising amount of power, which we'll get to in XXX.

The opposite of quoting is evaluating. This is a big topic, so it is covered in depth in the next chapter. For now, we'll focus on a single function: `rlang::eval_tidy()`. This takes an expression and evaluates it.

```{r}
x <- expr(runif(5))
x

eval_tidy(x)
eval_tidy(x)
```

Notice that every time we evaluate this expression we get a different result. This makes these expression different to the lazy evaluation of functions which are only evaluated once, and then return the same results again and again.

Quoting functions side-step evaluation, allowing you to capture the code. This allows you to inspect and transform the AST, or evaluate the code in a different way ("non-standard") to usual. Functions that use these tools are often called non-standard evaluation (NSE) functions. 

### Unquoting

There are two forms of unquoting, `!!` called unquote, and pronounced bang-bang, and `!!!` called unquote-splice, and pronounced bang-bang-bang. They both replace nodes in the AST. `!!` is a one-to-one replacement. It takes a single expression and inlines the AST at the location of the `!!`. 

```{r}
x <- expr(-1)
expr(f(!!x, y))
```

Graphically this looks like:

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/expression-bang-bang.png", dpi = 450)
```

`!!!` is a one-to-many replacement.  It takes a list of expressions and replaces them at the location of the `!!!`.

```{r}
x <- exprs(-1, -2)
expr(f(!!!x, y))
```


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = NULL}
knitr::include_graphics("diagrams/expression-bang-bang-bang.png", dpi = 450)
```

There's one final component to quasiquotation: `:=`, pronounced colon-equals. One challenge that sometimes crops up is that the LHS of `=` is always quoted. 

```{r}
name <- "x"
value <- 10

lobstr::ast(c(name = value))
lobstr::ast(c(name = !!value))
```

And you can't unquote on the LHS because in R's grammar is has to be a bare name, so attempting to unquote is a syntax error.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
lobstr::ast(c(!!name = !!value))
```

This doesn't work quite yet: https://github.com/tidyverse/rlang/issues/279

```{r}
lobstr::ast(c(!!name := !!value))
```

### Operator precedence and prefix forms

Sometimes using `!!` causese problems because `!!` isn't one thing - it's actually two `!` called back-to-back. We chose this notation in rlang because it's rarely used in R, and it's a clear signal that something weird is going on.

Unfortunately that sometimes causes problems because operator precednece:

```{r, error = TRUE}
x <- quote(X)
y <- quote(Y)
lobstr::ast(!!x + !!y)
```

You can solve this problem either by adding parentheses:

```{r}
lobstr::ast((!!x) + (!!y))
```

Or by using the regular function form of `!!`, `UQ()`:

```{r}
lobstr::ast(UQ(x) + UQ(y))
```

Note that using parentheses introduces additional nodes into the AST. These are usually not important.

THIS BEHAVIOUR MIGHT CHANGE.

### The downsides of non-standard evaluation {#nse-downsides}

The biggest downside of NSE is that functions that use it are no longer [referentially transparent](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency_(computer_science)). A function is __referentially transparent__ if you can replace its arguments with their values and its behaviour doesn't change. For example, if a function, `f()`, is referentially transparent and both `x` and `y` are 10, then `f(x)`, `f(y)`, and `f(10)` will all return the same result. Referentially transparent code is easier to reason about because the names of objects don't matter, and because you can always work from the innermost parentheses outwards. \index{non-standard evaluation!drawbacks}

There are many important functions that by their very nature are not referentially transparent. Take the assignment operator. You can't take `a <- 1` and replace `a` by its value and get the same behaviour. This is one reason that people usually write assignments at the top-level of functions. It's hard to reason about code like this:

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 2
if ((b <- a + 1) > (a <- b - 1)) {
  b <- b + 2
}
```

Using NSE prevents a function from being referentially transparent. This makes the mental model needed to correctly predict the output much more complicated. So, it's only worthwhile to use NSE if there is significant gain. For example, `library()` and `require()` can be called either with or without quotes, because internally they use `deparse(substitute(x))` plus some other tricks. This means that these two lines do exactly the same thing: \index{referential transparency}

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library("ggplot2")
```

Things start to get complicated if the variable is associated with a value. What package will this load?

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot2 <- "plyr"
library(ggplot2)
```

There are a number of other R functions that work in this way, like `ls()`, `rm()`, `data()`, `demo()`, `example()`, and `vignette()`. To me, eliminating two keystrokes is not worth the loss of referential transparency, and I don't recommend you use NSE for this purpose.

One situation where non-standard evaluation is worthwhile is `data.frame()`. If not explicitly supplied, it uses the input to automatically name the output variables:

```{r}
x <- 10
y <- "a"
df <- data.frame(x, y)
names(df)
```

I think it's worthwhile because it eliminates a lot of redundancy in the common scenario when you're creating a data frame from existing variables. More importantly, if needed, it's easy to override this behaviour by supplying names for each variable.

Non-standard evaluation allows you to write functions that are extremely powerful. However, they are harder to understand and to program with. As well as always providing an escape hatch, carefully consider both the costs and benefits of NSE before using it in a new domain.

### Exercises

1.  It's challenging to see the AST of code like `!!x + !!y` because  
    `ast()` does unquoting. We can work around this by using the base
    equivalent of `expr()` that doesn't do unquoting: `quote()`. Why does
    this work? What does it tell you about unquoting?
    
    ```{r}
    expr <- quote(!!x + !!y)
    lobstr::ast(!!expr)
    ```
    

## Base R

Now that you understand the basics of quasiquotation it's time to take a look at what base R does. You'll first learn about the quoting functions that base R uses, then learn the variety of techniques used for unquoting in base R.

### Quoting functions

* `quote()` is like `expr()` without quasiquotation.

* `substitute()` is similar to `enexpr()`. Its primary purpose is to
  capture unevaluated arguments, but it also does a bunch of other stuff
  including code expansion, and differs in behaviour when called from
  the top-level vs. inside a function.
  
    `substitute()` is commonly used in conjunction with `deparse()`:
    `deparse(substitute(x))` gives the expression used in argument `x`.

* There is no built-in equivalent to `exprs()` but you can write your own:
  
    ```R
    dots <- function(...) eval(substitute(alist(...)))
    ```
    
    This uses the code expansion part of `substitute()`.

* `bquote()` is like `expr()` but provides a more limited form of 
  quasiquotation. Can only unquote, not unquote-splice, using `.`.
  Not used to provide quasiquotation for any other function in R.

### Non-quoting

Because base R doesn't use quasiquotation, most quoting functions also have a non-quoting variant. There are four common forms which are conceptually similar to `!!`:

```{r, include = FALSE}
call <- names(pryr::find_uses("package:base", "match.call"))
subs <- names(pryr::find_uses("package:base", "substitute"))
eval <- names(pryr::find_uses("package:base", "eval"))

intersect(subs, eval)
```

*   A pair of quoting and non-quoting functions. For example, `$` has two 
    arguments, and the second argument is quoted. This is easier to see if you 
    write in prefix form: `mtcars$cyl` is equivalent to `` `$`(mtcars, cyl) ``. 
    If you want to refer to a variable indirectly, you use `[[` instead, as it 
    takes the name of a variable as a string.
      
    ```{r}
    x <- list(var = 1, y = 2)
    var <- "y"
    
    x$var
    x[[var]]
    ```
  
    Two other pairs that use the same approach are `<-` and `assign()`; 
    `::` and `getExportedValue()`.
    
*   A pair of quoting and non-quoting arguments. For example, `rm()` and 
    `save()` allow you to provide automatically quoted variable names in
    `...`, or a character vector of variable names in `list`.

    ```{r}
    x <- 1
    rm(x)

    y <- 2
    vars <- c("y", "vars")
    rm(list = vars)
    ```

*   An argument that controls whether a different argument is quoting or 
    non-quoting. For example, in `library()`, the `character.only` argument
    controls the quoting behaviour of of the first argument, `package`:
    
    ```{r, message = FALSE}
    library(MASS)
    
    pkg <- "MASS"
    library(pkg, character.only = TRUE)
    ```
    
    `require()` and `detach()` work similarly.

*   Quoting if evaluation fails. For example, the first argument to `help()`
    is non-quoting if it's an existing variable name (that points to a string);
    otherwise it is quoting. 
    
    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    # Shows help for var
    help(var)
    
    var <- "mean"
    # Shows help for me
    help(var)
    ```
    
    `ls()` also autoquotes it's first argument, `name`.

Note that all of these non-quoted forms use strings.

Finally, some quoting functions provide no way to unquote. Other functions like `subset()`, `transform()`, and `with()` are used primarily as wrappers around `[` and `[<-`; `replicate()`. These functions have no way to unquote, presumably because they're seen as wrappers around non-quoting functions. 

### `do.call`

Individual functions provide alternatives to `!!`. One function provides a collective alternative to `!!!` and `:=`: `do.call()`. `do.call()` allows you to call a function with a list of arguments, allowing you manipulate that list in the usual way.

```{r}
var <- "x"
value <- 1:3

do.call(data.frame, setNames(list(value), var))
```

Equivalent to `tibble(!!value := var)`.

Or if you have many data frames that you want to bind together, you can use `do.call()` + `rbind()`:

```{r}
dfs <- replicate(5, data.frame(x = runif(1)), simplify = FALSE)
do.call(rbind, dfs)
```

Equivalent to `bind_rows(!!!dfs)`.  (For historical reasons, `bind_rows(dfs)` also works but if I was to write it today, it would require explicit unsplicing.)


### Formulas

We'll come back to formulas in detail in the next chapter because as well as quoting its one or two arguments, it also captures the environment.

```{r}
lobstr::ast(x ~ y)
lobstr::ast(!!(x ~ y))
```

### Exercises

1.  Read the standard non-standard evaluation rules found at
    <http://developer.r-project.org/nonstandard-eval.pdf>.

1.  Why does `as.Date.default()` use `substitute()` and `deparse()`?
    Why does `pairwise.t.test()` use them? Read the source code.

1.  `pairwise.t.test()` assumes that `deparse()` always returns a length one 
    character vector. Can you construct an input that violates this expectation? 
    What happens?

1.  Base functions `match.fun()`, `page()`, and `ls()` all try to
    automatically determine whether you want standard or non-standard
    evaluation. Each uses a different approach. Figure out the essence
    of each approach then compare and contrast.

## Case study: constructing calls with quasiquotation {#construct-calls}

In base R, you can construct a call using the `call()` function. We are going to use the similar function `rlang::lang()`. The chief difference is that `lang()` supports quasiquotation. This makes it considerably easier to generate certain types of call.

The basics of `lang()` are simple. You create a call giving the name of a function, followed by the arguments:

```{r}
lang("+", 1, 2)
lang("foo", x = 1, y = 2)
```

Here we've used a convenient shortcut: we've given it the name of the fuction as a string not a call. In most cases a string is easier to type and directly equivalent to the `quote()`d equivalent:

```{r}
lang(expr(f), 1, 2)
lang("f", 1, 2)
```

However, this will not work if the function is generated by a function call. Note the subtle difference in these two calls:

```{r}
lang(quote(f()), 1, 2)
lang("f()", 1, 2)
```

The first uses the function generated by calling `f()`, the second calls a function with the confusing name `f()`:

```{r}
`f()` <- function(x) x + 1
`f()`(1)
```

To construct more complex calls, two new quasiquotation calls come in handy: 

*   `!!!`, pronounced bang-bang-bang, the unquote-splice operator. It allows you
    to splice in a list. Simply including the list in the call doesn't yield 
    quite what you want:

    ```{r}
    args <- list(x = 1, y = 2)
    lang("f", args, z = 3)
    ```
    
    Here we the unquote-splice operator:
    
    ```{r}
    lang("f", !!!args, z = 3)
    ```

*   `:=`, pronounced colon-equals, the definition operator. It works like `=` but
    allows you to splice on the left-hand side.

    ```{r}
    var <- "x"
    val <- 10
    
    lang("foo", var = val)
    lang("foo", !!var := val)
    ```

### Working around the absense of unquoting

`subset()`. `transform()`

`~` doesn't provide any way to unquote.

```{r}
make_model <- function(resp, preds) {
  pred_sum <- purrr::reduce(preds, function(x, y) expr(UQ(x) + UQ(y)))
  eval_tidy(expr(!!resp ~ !!pred_sum))
}
make_model(expr(y), exprs(a, b, c))
```

Note the use of `reduce()` to take a list of expressions and progressively add them together. This is a pleasant side effect of 

```{r}
binary_expr_reducer <- function(op) {
  op <- enexpr(op)
  
  function(x, y) {
    expr(UQ(op)(UQ(x), UQ(y)))
  }
}

x <- exprs(a, b, c, d)
purrr::reduce(x, binary_expr_reducer(`*`))
purrr::reduce_right(x, binary_expr_reducer(`*`))

purrr::reduce(x, binary_expr_reducer(f))
purrr::reduce_right(x, binary_expr_reducer(f))
```

How to use `expr()` + `eval_tidy()` to support wrap base functions.

```{r, error = TRUE, fig.keep = "none"}
library(lattice)
xyplot(mpg ~ disp, data = mtcars)

x <- quote(mpg)
y <- quote(disp)
xyplot(x ~ y, data = mtcars)
```

### Inlining and the deparser

If you construct ASTs by hand, it's possible to construct things that you could not construct by parsing code.  For example, if you forget to quote the first argument to `lang` it will literally inline the funtion call:

```{r}
lang(sum, quote(x))
```

It's also possible to inline objects that are not constants, symbols, or calls. This is useful in a handful of places (beyond the scope of the book, but typically useful in overscoping). The main thing to be aware of is that the the printed representation does not always accurately reflect the underlying tree. Trust `ast()` over what the console will print.

R will print parentheses that don't exist in the call tree:

```{r}
x1 <- lang("+", 1, lang("+", 2, 3))
x1
lobstr::ast(!!x1)
```

It will also display integer sequences as if they were generated with `:`.

```{r}
x2 <- lang("f", c(1L, 2L, 3L, 4L, 5L))
x2
lobstr::ast(!!x2)
```

If you inline more complex objects, their attributes are not printed which might lead to confusing output:

```{r}
x3 <- lang("class", data.frame(x = 10))
x3
eval(x3)

lobstr::ast(!!x3)
```

In general, if you're ever confused, remember to check the object with `ast()`!

### Exercises

1.  The following two calls look the same, but are actually different:

    ```{r}
    (a <- call("mean", 1:10))
    (b <- call("mean", quote(1:10)))
    identical(a, b)
    ```

    What's the difference? Which one should you prefer?

1.  Use `subs()` to convert the LHS to the RHS for each of the following pairs:
    * `a + b + c` -> `a * b * c`
    * `f(g(a, b), c)` -> `(a + b) * c`
    * `f(a < b, c, d)` -> `if (a < b) c else d`

2.  For each of the following pairs of expressions, describe why you can't
    use `subs()` to convert one to the other.
    * `a + b + c` -> `a + b * c`
    * `f(a, b)` -> `f(a, b, c)`
    * `f(a, b, c)` -> `f(a, b)`

1.  Concatenating a call and an expression with `c()` creates a list. Implement
    `concat()` so that the following code works to combine a call and
    an additional argument.

    ```{r, eval = FALSE}
    concat(quote(f), a = 1, b = quote(mean(a)))
    #> f(a = 1, b = mean(a))
    ```
